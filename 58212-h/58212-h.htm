<div style="font-size: 80%;">
<p>"That noble families are continued in a long succession of wealth,
honour, and reputation, is justly esteemed as one of the most
valuable of worldly blessings, as being the certain tokens of God
Almighty's providential favour, and the prudent conduct of such
ancestors,"&mdash;Nath. Johnston's <i>Account of the Family of Bruce Earl
of Aylesbury</i>, 1691, Harl. MS, 3879.</p></div>

<p>THE following imperfect attempt to bring together a few notes
relating to the ancient aristocracy of England, is confined in the
first place to the families <i>now existing</i>, and regularly
established either as <i>knightly</i> or <i>gentle</i> houses before the
commencement of the sixteenth century; secondly, no notice is taken
of those families who may have assumed the name and arms of their
ancestors in the <i>female line</i>: for the truth is, as it has been
well observed,* "that, unless we take the <i>male line</i> as the general
standard of genealogical rank, we shall find ourselves in a hopeless
state of confusion;" thirdly, illegitimate descent is of course
excluded; and, fourthly, where families have sold their original
estates, they will be noticed in those counties where they are at
present seated; if however they still possess the ancient estate of
their family, though they may <i>reside</i> in another county, they will
be mentioned for the most part under that county from whence they
originally sprung.</p>

<p>In those cases where the whole landed estate of the family has been
dissipated, although the male line still remains, all notice is
omitted, such families having no longer any claim to be classed in
any county. For, "ancient dignity was territorial rather than
personal, the whole system was rooted in the land, and, even in the
present day, though the land may have changed hands often, it has
carried along with it some of that sentiment of regard attached to
the lordship of it, as surely as its earth has the fresh smell which
it gives when upturned by the husbandman."**</p>

<p>This list also, it must be remembered, does not profess to give an
account of all those families whose descent may possibly be traced
beyond the year 1500, but merely of those who were in the position
of what we now call <i>county families</i> before that period. The line
of demarcation indeed between the families who rose upon the ruins
of the monastic system, and the more ancient aristocracy of England,
is often very difficult to be traced, depending as it does on
documentary evidence often inaccessible, and obscured by the
fanciful and too favourable deductions of the heralds of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>With regard to the sources from whence the following memoranda have
been taken, I have endeavoured as much as possible to rely upon the
best county histories and MS. collections of authority, and
carefully to eschew those modern accounts of family history, which,
by ascribing the most absurd pretensions of ancient lineage to
families who bore no <i>real</i> claim to that distinction, have done
much to bring genealogy itself into contempt among that numerous
class of readers who are but slightly acquainted with the subject.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without recording my obligations to several
gentlemen who have in the most liberal manner placed their
genealogical collections at my service, and by so doing rendered
less imperfect these notices of the noble and gentle houses of
England: among that number I wish particularly to mention the names
of the late Mr. Joseph Morris of Shrewsbury and Mr. Joseph Hunter,
one of the Assistant Keepers of the Records, the learned and
accurate historian of South Yorkshire.

<center><h3>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h3></center>
<hr width="50%">
<p>ANOTHER edition of this little work having been called for, I have
carefully revised and corrected what has been already written; I
have also made some additions, the result of further investigation,
and the information of many friends and correspondents, whose
courtesy and kindness I here beg most gratefully to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Since the book was published in the year 1859, the male lines of
three families, whose names were originally comprehended in it, have
become extinct, viz.: Cotton of Landwade, in the county of
Cambridge, Hornyold of Blackmore Park, and Hanford of Wollashill,
both in Worcestershire. On the other hand, notices of eight "<i>new
peers?</i>" will be found in the present volume, four of which also
occurred in the second edition. I allude to Lovett of Liscombe, in
the county of Buckingham, and Basset of Tehidy, in the county of
Cornwall&mdash;very ancient families, whose landed property being until
lately in female hands, could not, in accordance with the rules
which I had laid down, be comprehended in the first edition; I have
also added Huyshe of Sand, in Devonshire, Patten of Bank Hall,
in Lincolnshire, Bertie of Uffington, Anderson of Brocklesby, and
Massingberd of Wrangle, all in Lincolnshire, and, lastly, Upton of
Ashton Court, in the county of Somerset. And here I must again beg
to remind the reader, that the intention of this work is not to give
an account of every family whose pedigree may be continued in the
male line beyond the time which I have mentioned (the beginning of
the sixteenth century), but of those only who were established as
<i>county families</i>, "inheriting arms from their ancestors," at that
period. It is no doubt in many cases very difficult to distinguish
accurately the pretensions of many families who may possibly have a
fair claim to this distinction, though, from the reasons to which I
have formerly alluded, it is not easy to establish them. I can only
say that as far as my information extends I have endeavoured fairly
and honestly to draw the correct line, but whether I have succeeded
must be left to the judgment of others.

<p>"An ancient estate should always go to males. It is mighty foolish
to let a stranger have it because he marries your daughter and takes
your name. As for an Estate newly acquired by trade, you may give
it, if you will, to the dog <i>Towser</i>, and let him keep his <i>own</i>
name."&mdash;DR. JOHNSON.</p>

<br><img src="images/arms_page001.jpg" alt="arms_page001.jpg" class="img_left">
<p> THIS great and ancient Family, though not connected
with this county before the reign of Henry VIII., yet, having been
for a considerable time seated at Melchbourne, may with propriety be
included among the Bedfordshire families, and indeed stands alone as
the only one of knightly rank.* Descended in the direct male line
from Hugh de Port mentioned in Domesday, in the twelfth century
William son of Adam de Port took the name of St.John from the
heiress of that great Norman family. Basing in Hampshire, Stanton
St.John in Oxfordshire, Bletshoe in the county of Northampton,<span id="page1" class="pagenum"></span>
and Lydiard Tregoze in Wiltshire, both derived from the heiress of
Beauchamp in the reign of Henry VI.&mdash;have successively been seats of
the St.Johns, who have made themselves sufficiently remarkable both
for their loyalty and disloyalty in the reign of Charles I., not to
mention the ambition and ill-directed abilities of the great Lord
Bolingbroke in that of Anne.</p>

<p><i>Younger Branch</i>. St.John of Lydiard Tregoze, Viscount Bolingbroke
1712. Baronet 1611. Descended from Oliver, second son of Sir Oliver
St.John and the heiress of Beauchamp.</p>

<p>See Leland's Itinerary, edition 1769, vol. vi. folio 27, p. 26.
Brydges's Collins, vi. 42 and 741. For an account of Bletshoe, and
the monuments there, see Gent. Mag. 1799, p. 745. For Lydiard
Tregoze, and other monuments of the St.Johns, whose pedigree, by Sir
R. St.George, is painted on folding-doors on the north side of the
chancel, see the Topographer, i. 508.</p>

<p><span class="arms">

St.John in the thirteenth century bore in his arms the addition of a
bend gules, which was continued by his descendants till the reign of
Elizabeth. (Gent. Mag. 1787, 681.) The present coat was borne by Sir
John de St.John in the reign of Edward II.; at the same time other
members of the family varied the field and charges thus: Sir Roger
bore, <i>Ermine, on a chief gules two mullets or</i>; Sir Eymis, <i>Argent,
crusilly sable, on a chief gules two mullets or</i>; Sir John de
Layneham, <i>Argent, on a chief gules two mullets or, a border
indented sable</i>. John, heir of John de St.John, differenced his arms
with a label azure, according to the roll of Carlaverock. The roll
of arms of the reign of Richard II. gives the <i>mullets of six points
pierced azure</i>. Edward St.John at this period bore, <i>Argent, on a
chief dancetté gules two mullets of six points or, pierced vert</i>.

<br><img src="images/arms_page003.jpg" alt="arms_page003.jpg" class="img_left">
<p>This family is of ancient Kentish extraction, and is
a branch of the Polhills or Polleys of Preston, in Shoreham, in that
county, descended from John Polhill, eldest son of John Polhill and
Alice de Buckland, the heiress of Preston, in the reign of Henry VI.
The Rev. Richard Polwhele, the Historian of Cornwall, was of opinion
that the Polhills of Kent were a branch of the Cornish Polwheles,
which emigrated from the western into the eastern counties at a very
early period; they were certainly seated at Detling in
Hollingbourne, in Kent, at or previous to the reign of Edward III.
In the time of Elizabeth, the Polhills were of Frenches, in the
parish of Burwash, in Sussex. The immediate ancestor of the present
family was Nathaniel Polhill, of Burwash and Howbury, an eminent
merchant, who died in 1782.</p>

<p>See a very minute account of all the branches of this ancient family
in the Topographer and Genealogist, i. pp. 180 and 577. See also
Hasted's History of Kent, vol. i, p. 365, and vol. iii. p. 4.</p>

<p>It has been observed by old Fuller, "The Lands of
Berkshire are very skittish, and are apt to cast their owners;" and
again, "Of names which were in days of yore&mdash;few remain here of a
great store." The ancient family of Eyston, and the succeeding one
of Clarke, are indeed the only exceptions at the present day to this
rule. The Eystons have been seated at East Hendred since the reign
of Henry VI.; John Eiston, their ancestor, having at that period
married "Isabel, daughter and heir of John Stow, of Burford, co.
Oxford, whose wife was Maud, daughter and heir of Rawlin Arches, of
East Henreth, whose great-grandmother was Amy, daughter and heir of

<p>There is good reason to believe that this family,

of the Grenvilles of the West. The manor of Wotton, among many

Buckingham. Isabel, daughter and coheir of Walter the second Earl,
is said to have brought it in marriage, about the year 1097, to

<p>Vitalis Lovett of Rushton, in the county of
Northampton, who lived in the reign of Henry II., appears to be the
first proved ancestor of this venerable family, said to be of Norman
origin. William Lovett of Rushton, the son of Vitalis, held certain
lands in Henwick, also in Northamptonshire, of Richard Engaine and
his heirs by the service of finding two horsemen to follow the said
Richard to hunt the wolf in any part of England. This service was
remitted to John Lovet, son or grandson of William, in the reign of
Edward I., and in lieu thereof an annual rent-charge of ten
shillings was imposed. Soon after this period, viz: in 1304, (33
Edw. I.) Liscombe in the parish of Soulbury came into the family,
being in the possession of Robert Lovett and Sarah his wife,
daughter and heir of Sir Roger Turvile, from the second marriage of
their son Thomas, descended the Lovetts of Astwell in
Northamptonshire, since the reign of Elizabeth represented in the
female line by the Shirleys Earls Ferrers. Liscombe has from the
beginning of the fourteenth century remained the inheritance of the
elder branch of the Lovetts, though the direct descent has been
often interrupted. In 1781, Jonathan Lovett, the representative of
the family, was created a baronet by King George III. His Majesty's
remark on this occasion is preserved in Betham's Baronetage. "In the
summer of 1781, the Earl of Chesterfield having been some time
absent from court, was asked by the King where he had been so
long?<span id="page10" class="pagenum"></span> 'On a visit to Mr. Lovett of Buckinghamshire,' said the
Earl. 'Ah,' said the King, 'is that Lovett of Liscombe? They are of
the genuine old Norman breed, how happens it that they are not
baronets? would they accept the title? Go tell him,' continued the
King, 'is that the title is much at his service; they have ever
stuck to the Crown at a pinch.'" The same work also gives a very
curious, and to an antiquary very tantalizing, account of the
ancient armour and documents once preserved at Liscombe, and
describes their melancholy fate. Sir Jonathan Lovett having died
without surviving male issue in 1812, the title of Baronet became
extinct and the property descended to his daughters; on the decease
of the survivor, Miss Eliza Lovett, in 1861, the ancient seat of
this venerable family reverted by her will to the next male heir,
the present representative of the family, descended from a younger
brother of Sir Jonathan Lovett, baronet.</p>

period. His grandson was called Ralf of Westley, alias Bendishe, and
from him this ancient family, one branch of which was long settled
at Steeple Bumstead, in Essex, is descended. A manor in Barrington
came from the heiress of Bradfield early in the fifteenth century,
and had acquired the name of "The Manor of Bendyshe" so far back as
the year 1493; it has ever since remained the inheritance of this

house of the Davenports at Devonport; a great old house covered with
leade on the Ripe of Daven, three miles above Congleton," became
extinct in 1674. The coheiresses married Davies and Davenport of
Woodford. Ormus de Daumporte, living in the time of William I., is
the first recorded ancestor of this family. To his son, Richard de
Dauneporte, Hugh Earl of Chester gave the chief foresterships of the

held by this house.</p>

younger son of Thomas, second son of Sir Thomas Davenport of
Davenport, the 13th of Edward II. Woodford was granted by John
Stafford and Isabella his wife, about the time of Edward III., to
John, third son of Thomas Davenport of Wheltrough, (an elder line
not traced beyond 1677,) while the Davenports of Henbury were
extinct before 1664. Davenport of Calveley, founded by Arthur, sixth
son of Sir John Davenport of Davenport, killed at Shrewsbury in
1403, became extinct in 1771. The coheiresses married Bromley<span id="page13" class="pagenum"></span>
and Davenport of Woodford. Davenport of Bramhall, founded by the
second son of Thomas Davenport of Wheltrough and the heiress of
Bramhall, in the time of Edward III., survived till 1838. The
Davenports of Davenport House, in the parish of Worfield, in
Shropshire, are the only younger branch now remaining; they spring

<p>Tremayne is in the parish of St. Martin, and here the

assumed the local name. This estate passed with the heiress of the
elder branch of the family to the Trethurfes, and from them to the
Reskymers, to whom it belonged in Leland's time. A grandson of the
first Tremayne, having married the heiress of Trenchard, of
Collacomb, in Devonshire, removed hither, where his descendants
existed till the extinction of that line in 1808. The founder of the
present family was Richard Tremayne, whose son purchased Helligan in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and who is thus noticed by Carew in
his Survey of this county. "At the adjoining St. Ive, dwelleth
master Richard Tremayne, descended from a younger brother of
Colocome House in Devon, who, being learned in the laws, is yet to
learne, or at least to practise, how he may make other profit
thereby, then by hoarding up treasure of gratitude in the mindful
breasts of poor and rich, on whom he gratis bestoweth the fruits of
his pains and knowledge."</p>

<p>The pedigree begins with Hugo de Burdet, who came
into England with William I., and was lord of the manor of Loseby,
in Leicestershire, in 1066. Arrow, in the county of Warwick, which
came from the heiress of Camvile the 9th of Edward II., was long the
seat of the Burdetts, but they had long before, as Dugdale shows,
been connected by property with that county, William Burdett having
founded the cell of Ancote, near Sekindon, in the fifth of Henry II.
The manor of Arrow, and many other estates of this family, carried
by an heiress to the Conways in the reign of Henry VII., became the
fruitful cause of many lawsuits, which were not finally settled till
the end of the reign of Henry VIII. See Dugdale for the curious
details. Foremark was inherited from the heiress of Francis in 1602.</p>

generations Efford, in the parish of Egg-Buckland, was the seat of
this family, but in the early part of the seventeenth century the
hereditary estates were sold, and they were of Wolston and Garston,
in West Allington. About the beginning of the eighteenth century
Kitley, the present seat, was inherited from the heiress of
Pollexfen.</p>

<p>In 1779, William Bastard, Esq., the representative of this family,
was gazetted a Baronet: the honour, which was declined by Mr.
Bastard, was intended as an acknowledgment of his services in
raising men to defend Plymouth in 1779.</p>

<p>Acland, which gave name to this ancient family, is

Westcote's Devonshire, (p. 290:) "Then Landkey, or Londkey; and
therein Acland, or rather Aukeland, as taking name from a grove of
oaks, for by such an one the house is seated, and hath given name
and long habitation to the <i>clarous</i> family of the Aclands, which
have many ages here flourished in a worshipful degree." Hugh de
Accalen is the first recorded ancestor; he was living in 1155; from
whom the present Sir Thomas Dyke Acland is twenty-second in lineal
descent. Killerton, in the parish of Broad-Clist, purchased at the
beginning of the seventeenth century, is the present seat of the

Digbys; and by the will of the last Earl Digby, who died in 1856,
the manor of Coleshill, in Warwickshire, granted by Henry VII. to

been alienated from the male line of the family.</p>

<p>This is a very ancient Shropshire family, descended
from Sir Adam Wolryche, Knight, of Wenlock, living in the reign of
Henry III., and who, previous to being knighted, was admitted of the
Roll of Guild Merchants of the town of Shrewsbury in 1231, by the
old Saxon name of "Adam Wulfric." His descendant Andrew Wolryche was
M. P. for Bridgnorth in 1435, being then of Dudmaston, where the
elder branch of this family was seated for a considerable period,
created Baronets in 1641, extinct in 1723. The present family
descend from Edward, third son of Humphry Wolryche, Esq. grandson of
Andrew Wolryche, which Humphry is recorded as one of the "Gentlemen"
of Shropshire, in the seventeenth of Henry VII., 1501. There were
branches of the family, now extinct, at Cowling and Wickhambroke,
Suffolk, and Alconbury, Huntingdonshire.</p>

<p>"In point of antiquity, and former feudal power,

Descended from Gospatric, the Saxon Earl of Northumberland, whose
great-grandson, marrying the heiress of Neville, gave that name to
his posterity, for many ages the Nevilles were Barons of Raby and
Earls of Westmerland. The last Earl was attainted in the 13th of
Elizabeth. A younger branch of the Nevilles, in the person of Sir
Edward Neville, obtained the castle and barony of Abergavenny, and
the estate of Birling, with the heiress of Beauchamp, in the reign
of Henry VI.; and the present family is descended from this match,
having been Barons of Abergavenny previously to the creation of the
Earldom. Birling was long deserted by the family, whose principal
seat was afterwards at Sheffield, and Eridge, in Sussex; but it is
now the residence of Lord Abergavenny.</p>

both of England and Ireland, are descended, according to Camden,
from the same progenitors: the pedigree therefore is extended to the

Lancashire branch were not settled there till the reign of Edward
III., when they became possessed of Bryn, by marriage with the

<p>Although Sir Rowland Stanley Errington, brother of
Sir William Massey Stanley, late of Hooton, in the county of
Chester, Baronet, is in fact the head of this illustrious house,
yet, as that estate has been sold, and his family have now no
connection with Cheshire, the Earl of Derby must be considered the

Stanley.</p>

<p>As few families have acted a more prominent part in History, so few
can trace a more satisfactory pedigree. Descended from a younger
branch of the Barons Audeley, of Audeley in Staffordshire, the name
of Stanley, from the manor of that name in this county, in the reign
of John, was assumed by William de Audleigh. Sir John Stanley, K.G.,
Lord Deputy of Ireland, in 1381 married the heiress of Lathom, and
thus became possessed of Knowesley; it was this Sir John also who
obtained a grant of the Isle of Man, which afterwards descended to
the Murrays Dukes of Athol till 1765. The principal branch of this
family became extinct on the death of James, tenth Earl, in 1736;
when the earldom descended on Sir Edward Stanley of Bickerstaff,
Baronet, descended from Sir James Stanley, brother of Thomas second
Earl of Derby.</p>

<p>For Stanley of Hooton, see Ormerod's Cheshire, ii. 230. The famous,
or rather infamous, Sir William Stanley was of this line.</p>

son of Sir Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baronet, who died in 1653; and the

Leicestershire begins with Thomas Wollaston of Perton, "a person of
figure in the reigns of Henry VII. and VIII." In 1709, William
Wollaston, Esq., the celebrated author of "The Religion of Nature,"
compiled an account of this family, which is printed in the History
of Leicestershire. He was the direct ancestor of the present family,
who have been also seated at Oncott, in Staffordshire, and
Finborough Hall, in Suffolk. Shenton was acquired early in the reign
of James I.</p>

de Maners, who obtained a grant of land in Berrington in 1327, and
was M.P. for Northumberland in 1340. His son William Maners, of
Etal, died before 1324, which estate appears to have been inherited
from an heiress of Muschamp. At the end of the fifteenth century, by
marriage with the heiress of the baronial family of Roos, the house
of Manners came into possession of the Castle of Belvoir. In the
succeeding century, a fortunate match with the heiress of Vernon of
Haddon still further increased the wealth and importance of this
noble family.</p>

<p>The royal title of Rutland, which had belonged to the house of York,
was conferred upon Thomas Lord Roos in 1525 as the grandson of the
lady Anne of York, sister to King Edward the Fourth.</p>

<p>This very ancient family is descended from Lambert
Massyngberd of Soterton, now Sutterton, in this county, who lived in
the reign of Edward I. and has ever since remained in Lincolnshire.
In the latter part of the fifteenth century, by the marriage of Sir
Thomas Massyngberd with the heiress of Braytoft of Braytoft Hall in
Gunby, the Massingberds removed to that place, which<span id="page140" class="pagenum"></span> became
the principal seat of their descendants. Ormsby, purchased from the
Skipwiths in 1636, and afterwards Gunby Hall, built by Sir William
Massingberd, the 2nd Baronet of this family, in 1699, was their
principal residence, till it went by an heiress to a younger branch
of the Langtons, who have assumed the name. Wrangle is a recent
purchase in this county by the present representative of the male
line of the family. The Massingberds early embraced the Reformed
faith. Thomas Massingberd, the last representative for Calais in
1552, "fled abroad for his religion" under Mary. Nevertheless his
descendant, William Burrell Massingberd of Ormsby, joined Prince
Charles Edward at Derby: a miniature given to him by the Prince is
still in the family. Ormsby belongs at present to a younger branch
of the Mundys of Markeaton in Derbyshire, who have assumed the name
of Massingberd.</p>

<p>The ancient extraction of the Berties from Berstead
in the county of Kent is proved by the Thurnham charters in the
possession of Sir Edward Dering, and by various public records of
undoubted authority; and, although the exact line of pedigree is by
no means clear, there appears no reason to doubt the descent of this
"undefamed house" from John or Bartholomew de Bereteghe, who were
living in the 35th of Edward I. The marriage of Richard Bertie son
of Robert, who died in 1500, with Katherine daughter of William
Willoughby, last Lord Willoughby of Eresby, and widow of Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, was, as is well known, the origin of the
consequence of this right loyal family, five generations of whose
history have been so agreeably illustrated by Lady Georgiana Bertie.
Grimsthorpe, inherited from the Duchess of Suffolk from her paternal
Willoughby ancestors, became the principal seat of the Berties,
Barons Willoughby of Eresby and Lords Great Chamberlains of England,
advanced in the person of Robert second Lord Willoughby to the
Earldom of Lindsey by King Charles I. His great-grandson was created
Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven in 1715, which titles became extinct
on the decease of the fifth Duke in 1809. The Earldom of Lindsey and
representation of the family thereupon devolved on the father of the
present Earl, descended from the fifth son of the second Earl of
Lindsey by his first wife.</p>

<p>Younger branch, the Earl of Abingdon 1682, Baron Norreys of Rycote
1572, descended from the second marriage of the second Earl of
Lindsey and the heiress of Wray, whose mother was the<span id="page144" class="pagenum"></span> sole
heir of Francis Norreys, Earl of Berkshire, and Lord Norreys of
Rycote.</p>

<p>The great historical house of Howard in point of
antiquity must yield precedence to many other English families: it
can only be traced with certainty to Sir William Howard, Judge of
the Common Pleas in 1297. Norfolk appears to be the county where
this great family should be noticed, the Duke of Norfolk still
possessing property in the county of his dukedom derived from his
ancestors of the house of Bigod. In the fourteenth century, by the
match with the heiress of Mowbray, the foundation of the honors and
consequence of the Howards was laid, the first Duke being the son of
Margaret, daughter and coheir of Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
The Sussex estates came from the heiress of Fitzalan, Earl of
Arundel, in the reign of Edward VI.; Worksop from the Talbots;
Greystoke and Morpeth from the Dacres.</p>

<p>All the English Peers of the house of Howard are traced to a common
ancestor in Thomas, the second Duke of Norfolk, who died in 1524.
The Duke of Norfolk, the Earls of Suffolk and Carlisle, descend from
his first wife, and the Earl of Effingham from the second. The
Howards of Greystoke, in Cumberland, are a younger branch of the
present ducal house. The Howards of Corby Castle, in the same
county, descend from the second son of "Belted Will," the ancestor
of the house of Carlisle.</p>

<p>Extinct branches. The Viscount Bindon; the Earls of Northampton,
Nottingham, and Stafford; and Lord Howard of Escrick.</p>

remembrance of the victory gained over the Scots at Flodden. The
present coat was borne by Sir John Howard in the reign of Edward
II., and by Mr. Howard in those of Edward II. and Richard III.: it
has been conjectured, from the similarity of this coat with that of
the Botilers, Barons of Wem, (Gules, a fess cheeky argent and sable
between six crosses pateé fitchée argent,) that Sir William Howard
the Judge was descended from the Hords, stewards to these Barons: it
is observable that none of the Howards ever prefixed the <i>de</i> to
their name, a fact which opposes their derivation from Hawarden in
Flintshire. (Blakeway's Sheriffs of Shropshire, pp. 53 note.)</span>

<p>This is a younger branch of the Gurneys of West
Barsham in this county, whose principal male line became extinct in
1661, West Barsham came from the heiress of Waunci about the reign
of Edward III. Previous to that time the Gurneys appear to have been
seated at Harpley, also in Norfolk, as early as 1206, and are traced
for two descents beyond that period, being (as there appears no
reason to doubt) descended from the great Norman baronial house of
the name. The present family may be said to have been refounded by
John Gurney, an eminent silk-merchant at Norwich, about 1670.
Keswick was purchased in 1747. The Gournays of Somersetshire,
represented by the Earls of Egmont, may have been a distinct family;
their arms were, Paly of six or and azure. Dugdale, however, gives
them a common ancestor with the former house. (Baronage, i. 429.)</p>

<p>This ancient family is supposed to have the same
origin as the noble Norman house of Grey, now represented by the
Earl of Stamford; it is traced to William de Grey, of Cavendish, in
Suffolk; whose grandson Sir Thomas was seated about 1306 at Cornerth
in that county, by his marriage with the heiress of the same name;
their son and heir married the coheiress of Baynard, and thus became

<p>This family is said to have been established at a
period shortly subsequent to the Conquest at Letheringsett, in
Norfolk, but is better known as a Suffolk family, having been seated
at Monks' Bradfield, in that county, in the reign of Richard I.
Redgrave was granted by Henry VIII. in the 36th year of his reign,
to the great Sir Nicholas Bacon, who with Francis his son, Viscount
St. Alban's, were the principal ornaments of this family.
Raveningham descended to the Bacons from the heiress of the ancient

<p>The ancestors of this ancient house were seated at
Horham in Suffolk in the 13th century, "knights of high esteem in
those parts," saith Camden, and traced to Sir Hubert Jernegan of
that place. Somerleyton, in the same county, derived from the
heiress of Fitzosbert, afterwards became the family seat, and so
continued until the extinction of the elder line. Cossey was granted
to Sir Henry Jerningham, (son of Sir Edward Jerningham, by his
second wife,) in 1547, by Queen Mary, "being the first that appeared
openly for her after the death of Edward VI." He was the ancestor of
Lord Stafford.</p>

Havile, but the pedigree as given by Collins cannot be relied on,
neither can the defamatory account of Leland, who says&mdash;"the
grandfather of Townsende now living was a meane man of substance."

Scogan, and flourished about the year 1400.</p>

<p>This is a younger branch of the very ancient baronial
house of Wake, who were Lincolnshire Barons in the reign of Henry I.
Sir Hugh Wake was lord of Deeping in the county of Lincoln, and of
Blisworth in this county, by gift of his father, Baldwin fourth Lord
Wake. He died in 1315, and was the direct ancestor of the present

<p>William de Bredenhill, seated at Dodington in

<p>The first recorded ancestor of this ancient family is
Rainald, mesne lord of Knightley, in the county of Stafford, under
Earl Roger, in the time of William the Conqueror, as appears by
Domesday Book. That estate went out of the family by an heiress who
married Robert de Peshall, about the reign of Edward III., and the
Knightleys removed to Gnowsall, in the same county, in the 17th of
Richard II. (1394). Fawsley was purchased in the 3rd of Henry V.
(1415-16). It is thus mentioned by Leland: "Mr. Knightley, a man of
great lands, hath his principal house at Foullesle, but it is no
very sumptuous thing." (Itin. i. fol. 11.)</p>

<p>See Baker's Northamptonshire, i. 381. Blakeway (Sheriffs of Salop,

<p>The Spencers claim a collateral descent from the
ancient baronial house of Le Despenser, a claim which, without being
irreconcileable perhaps with the early pedigrees of that family,
admits of very grave doubts and considerable difficulties. It seems
to be admitted that they descend from Henry Spencer, who, having
been educated in the Abbey of Evesham, obtained from the abbot in
the reign of Henry VI. a lease of the domains and tithes of Badby in
this county, and was induced to settle there. His son removed to
Hodnell in Warwickshire, his grandson to Rodburn in the same county,
his great-grandson Sir John purchased Althorpe in 1508. The Spencers
of Claverdon, co. Warwick (extinct 1685), were a younger branch. The
Dukes of Marlborough (1702) represent the elder line of this family.</p>

Badby, who sealed his will with it. In 1504 another coat was

Ecclesfield, and also at Sandal-Parva, in South Yorkshire, where
William Rokeby was Rector in the reign of Henry VII. In 1512 he

<p>Descended from Mathew, brother of John, who is said
to have held the Castle of Mitford soon after the Conquest, and by
whose only daughter and heiress it went to the Bertrams. The
ancestors of the present family appear to have been for many ages
resident at Mitford, though the castle was not in their possession
till it was granted with the manor by Charles II. to Robert Mitford,
Esq.</p>

<p>Younger Branches. Mitford of Pitshill, co. Sussex, descended from
the fourth son of Robert Mitford of Mitford Castle, Esq., Sheriff of
Yorkshire in 1702. Mitford of Exbury, co. Southampton, sprung from
the third son of Robert Mitford, of Mitford Castle, Esq., who died
in 1674. From this latter branch Mitford Baron Redesdale (1803) of
Batsford, co. Gloucester, is derived.</p>

<br><img src="images/arms_page169.jpg" alt="arms_page169.jpg" class="img_left">
<p>Swinburne in this county gave name to this ancient
family, the first recorded ancestor being John, father of Sir
William de Swinburne, living in 1278, and Alan Swinburne, Rector of
Whitfield, who purchased Capheaton from Sir Thomas Fenwick, Knt., in
1274.</p>

<p>Chollerton in Northumberland was also an ancient seat of the
Swinburnes; it was held under the great Umfrevile family by this
same Sir William de Swinburne, the arms being evidently founded upon
the coat of the Umfreviles. The date of the baronetcy points to the
loyalty of the family during the civil wars of the seventeenth
century.</p>

ever since remained in the possession of his descendants, and has

<p>This is the eldest branch of the great family of

Robert le Blount, whose name is found recorded in Domesday, was a
considerable landholder in Suffolk, Ixworth in that county being the
seat of his Barony. Belton in Rutlandshire was afterwards inherited
by his descendants from the Odinsels, and Hampton-Lovet, in the
county of Worcester, from the Lovet family. In 1404, Nicholas le
Blount, who had been deeply engaged in the conspiracy to restore
Richard II. to his throne, changed his name to Croke, on his return
to England, in order to avoid the revenge of Henry IV. The Crokes
afterwards became a legal family, and seated themselves at Chilton
in Buckinghamshire. The priory of Studley was purchased from Henry
VIII. by John Croke, in 1539.</p>

Richard, of Annesley, in the county of Nottingham, mentioned in the
Domesday Survey. That estate continued in the Annesleys till the
death of John de Annesley, Esq., in 1437, when it went by an heiress
to the Chaworths. The family then removed to Rodington in the same
county, and afterwards to Newport-Pagnell in Buckinghamshire; but
Ireland was the scene of the prosperity of the family, early in the
seventeenth century, which may be said to have been re-founded by
Sir Francis Annesley, Secretary of State in 1616. Hence the
Viscountcy of Valentia, which afterwards merged in the Earldom of
Anglesey in England, adjudged by the English House of Lords to be
extinct in 1761; but by the same evidence the Viscountcy of Valentia
was allowed to the grandson of the last Earl of Anglesey, whom the
English House of Lords found to be illegitimate. He was created Earl
of Mountnorris in Ireland in 1793, and on the decease of the last

Brokesby" occurs among the gentlemen of Leicestershire, "that be

was in the reign of James I., when the favourite Sir George Villiers
became Duke of Buckingham in 1623, extinct 1687. The Earls of Jersey

the Corbets divided into two branches; the elder was seated at
Wattlesborough, the younger at Caus-Castle. In the time of Henry
III. the former became of Moreton-Corbet, derived from the heiress
of the Anglo-Saxon family of Toret; but the Caus-Castle line was by
far the most eminent, and became barons of the realm. In the reign
of Richard II. several of the most ancient of the Corbet estates
were lost by an heiress; and this happened again in 1583, when the
lands brought into the family by the heiress of Hopton went by
marriage to the Wallops and Careys. Moreton-Corbet remained till
1688, when it also descended to the sister of Sir Vincent Corbet;

<p>The Leightons are stated to have been seated at
Leighton in this county prior to the Conquest: Domesday has "Rainald
(vicecom') ten' <i>Lestone</i>; Leuui tenuit temp. Reg. Edw." Hence there
can be no doubt the name Lestone, <i>i.e.</i> Lewi's-town, now Leighton,
was derived. Certain it is that the direct ancestors of the family
of Leighton were resident there at the very commencement of the
twelfth century. From Rainald the sheriff, who was the superior lord
of Leighton when Domesday was compiled, that and all his other
manors passed in marriage with his daughter to Alan, the ancestor of
the Fitz-Alan family; and in the <i>Liber Niger</i>, under the year 1167,
Richard son of Tiel (Tihel) is stated to hold Leighton under William
Fitz-Alan by the service of one knight. This Richard was the
undoubted ancestor of this ancient family. Leighton is now severed
from the inheritance of the male line of the Leightons, belonging to
Robert Gardner, Esq., whose wife was the heiress of the Kinnersleys,
descended in the female line from the second marriage of Sir Thomas
Leighton, knighted in 1513. Church Stretton, acquired by the heiress
of Cambray in the fifteenth century, was for four generations the

Testa de Nevill, King Henry II. gave him the manors of Rowton and
Ellardine, in the parish of High Ercall, and Sutton and Brocton in
the parish of Sutton, to be held in capite by the service of being
<i>latimer</i> (<i>i.e.</i> interpreter) between the English and Welsh. He
married Matilda, younger sister and coheir of Ralph le Strange, and
in her right became possessed of the manor of Kinnerley and other
estates in Shropshire. Madoc, the eldest son of Griffith, seated
himself at Sutton, from him called to this day "Sutton Madoc;"
Griffith Vychan, the younger son, had Kinnerley, a portion of his
mother's inheritance, and in that manor he resided at Tre-gynvarth,
<i>Anglicè</i> Kynvarth's Town, usually written and spoken as <i>Kynaston</i>;
and hence the name of the family. Griffith or Griffin de Kyneveston,
son of Griffith Vychan, was witness to a grant of land to the abbey
of Haghmond in 1313. His lineal descendant Roger Kynaston fought at
Blore Heathe in 1459, and Lord Audley the Lancastrian General is
supposed to have fallen by his hand; hence the second quarter in the
arms, and for this and other services he received the honour of
knighthood. The Kynastons, from the place so called, went to

Robert de Harley, who having married the coheiress of Brampton
Bryan, in the county of Hereford, that place became the residence of

<p>The name is derived from Walcot in the parish of
Lydbury, which was held under the Bishop of Hereford by Roger de
Walcot in 1255. He was the ancestor of the present family. Sixth in
descent from Roger de Walcot was John Walcot, of whom the pedigree
relates, "that playing at Chess with King Henry V. he gave him the
check-mate with the rooke, whereupon the King changed his coat of
arms, which was the cross with fleurs-de-lis, and gave him the rooke
for a remembrance." Walcot was sold in the year 1764, and Bitterley,
which had belonged to the family in 1660, became the seat of the
Walcots, descended from Humphry Walcot, who died in 1616, and who
was the eldest son of John Walcot of Walcot. He had livery of the
manor of Walcot in 1611, "on the extinction (says Blakeway,) I

Roger Baldwin of Diddlebury died anno 1398, and was the ancestor of
the family. Diddlebury was sold to the Cornewalls of Berrington in
the last century, when the Baldwins removed to Aqualate in

<p>A branch of the Dods of Edge in Cheshire, now extinct
in the male line, and one of the oldest families in England, which
can be traced in a direct line, undoubtedly of <i>Saxon</i>, if not of
<i>British</i> descent, which, says Blakeway, "is in the highest degree
probable." The following is Ormerod's account of the origin of this
family. "About the time of Henry II., Hova, son of Cadwgan Dot,
married the daughter and heiress of the Lord of Edge, with whom he
had the fourth of that manor. It is probable that the Lord of Edge
was son of Edwin, who before the Conquest was sole proprietor of
eight manors; we may call him a Saxon thane. It appears by Domesday
that Dot was the Saxon lord of sixteen manors, from all of which he
was ejected; we may presume he was identical with Cadwgan Dot." "A
descent in the male line (adds Ormerod) from a Saxon noticed in
Domesday would be unique in this county" (Cheshire). The Dods of
Cloverley descend from Hugo, living in the fourteenth of Henry IV.,
who married the coheiress of Roger de Cloverley. He was the son of
John Dod of Farndon, who was son of Roger Dod of Edge, living in the
reign of Edward III., which John Dod had also acquired property in
Shropshire, by marriage with the coheiress of Warden of Ightfield.</p>

carried by an heiress to Sir Francis Winnington in the reign of
Charles II. Richard Salwey, younger brother of Edward Salwey of
Stanford, was seated at Richard's Castle in the county of Hereford
at the time of the Protectorate. His grandson Richard was of the
Moor Park, where he died in 1759, and was succeeded by his
great-nephew, whose grandson is the present representative of this

beginning of the eighteenth century. The present representative,
succeeding to the estates of the Smyths of Ashton, assumed that

Over and Nether Wallop, so called, says Camden, "from Well-hop, that
is, a pretty well in the side of a hill," continued till the reign
of Henry V. the principal seat, when Margaret de Valoynes brought
into the family the manor of Farley, afterwards called
Farley-Wallop, which has since been the usual residence of the
Wallops; of whom Sir John was greatly distinguished in the reign of
Henry VII., and Sir Henry in Ireland in that of Elizabeth. Robert
Wallop, grandson of Sir Henry, unfortunately taking part against his

<p>An ancient Derbyshire family, which can be traced to
the reign of Henry II. One of their most ancient possessions was
Langley-Meynell, in that county, an estate which remained in the
family till the end of the fourteenth century. A younger son at this
period was seated at Yeaveley, his grandson at Willington, both in
Derbyshire. Bradley, in the same county, became in the seventeenh
century, by purchase, the residence of a still younger branch,
descended from Francis, fourth son of Godfrey Meynell of Willington:
from him descends the present family, who were of Hore-Cross the
latter part of the last century. Temple-Newsom, in Yorkshire, was
inherited from the Ingrams by the present Mr. Meynell on the death
of the Marchioness of Hertford in 1835.</p>

<p>Younger Branch. Meynell of Langley-Meynell, Derbyshire, descended
from Francis, second son of Francis Meynell, of Willington, who died

remarked that Robert, third in descent from the first Robert de

they had other lands in that parish, and for two descents were
called Snead alias Tunstall. Bradwell, the former seat of this
family, was purchased in the reign of Henry IV. The fine old house
at Keel, lately taken down and now rebuilt, was erected by Ralph
Sneyd, Esq. in 1581. During the Usurpation, the Sneyds being on the
loyal side, Keel house narrowly escaped destruction, and many of the
ancient evidences were plundered and lost at that time.</p>

<p>The ancient seat of this family was at Bentley in
this county, of which Richard Lane was possessed in the sixth of
Henry VI. The Lanes can be traced to Adam de Lone de Hampton,
grandfather of Richard de le Lone de Hampton, in the ninth of Edward
II. (1315). The three last Lanes of Bentley each lessened the
estate, mainly from their devotion to the ill-fated house of Stuart;
and the fourth, John Lane, sold Bentley in 1748. This family, even
more than the Giffords and Whitgreaves, can lay claim to be
remembered for its loyalty to Charles II. after his flight from
Worcester. The celebrated Jane Lane was the daughter of the then
head of the house, and rode behind the King from Bentley to Bristol.
King's Bromley was inherited from the Newtons about the end of the

from Geoffry de Barnardiston, of Barnardiston in this county, who
was living in the reign of Edward I., and who by his marriage with
the daughter and coheir of Newmarch became possessed of the
adjoining manor of Kedington or Ketton, which continued the seat and
residence of the Barnardistons, created Baronet in 1663, until the
death of Sir John the sixth Baronet of Ketton, in 1745. The present
family descended from Thomas Barnardiston, a merchant in London, who
died in 1681, fifth son of Sir Thomas of Ketton, Knight, and Mary,
daughter of Sir Richard Knightley. Besides the elder and principal

Percevals, is according to Brydges, in his Biographical Peerage, not
without some doubts. It appears, however, certain that he was the

<p>Although the foundation of the consequence of this
family was laid by Richard Onslow, a celebrated lawyer of the reign
of Elizabeth, yet he was sprung from an old gentle family seated at
Onslow in Shropshire, as far back as the time of Richard I., and
probably much earlier. The first recorded ancestor is John de
Ondeslowe, whose grandson, Warin, was father of "Roger de Ondeslow
juxta Shrewsbury," whose son Thomas was living in the twelfth of
Edward II. 1318. Richard Onslow became Speaker of the House of
Commons, and died in 1571. He was the first of his family connected
with Surrey, by his marriage with Catherine, daughter and heir of
Richard Harding, of Knoll, in this county, in the year 1554.
West-Clandon was purchased in 1641 by Sir Richard Onslow, created a
Baronet in 1660; the ancient family estate of Onslow having been
sold by Edward Onslow in 1617.</p>

<p>Younger Branches. Onslow of Altham in the county of Lancaster,
Baronet 1797, descended from the next brother of the Right Hon.
Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1726<span id="page251" class="pagenum"></span> to

from the second son of Sir Richard Onslow, the first Baronet.</p>

<p>"A family of stupendous antiquity," writes Fuller.
"The most ancient family in these tracts," according to Camden.
"Genealogists have given them a Saxon origin," says Brydges; "but
that is a fact very difficult to be proved, though very commonly
asserted. They do not, I believe, appear in Domesday Book." There
can be no doubt, however, that the Ashburnhams have been seated at
Ashburnham from the reign of Henry II., and probably from a much
earlier period, and are descended from Bertram, Constable of Dover
in the reign of William the Conqueror. By the improvidence of Sir
John Ashburnham, who died in 1620, this ancient patrimony was lost
for a time, but recovered by Frances Holland, the wife of his eldest
son John (the groom of the bed-chamber to Charles I.), who sold her
whole estate, and laid out the money in redeeming Ashburnham.</p>

<p>Younger Branch. Ashburnham of Bromham in this county, Baronet 1661,

<p>The name is derived from Goring, in the rape of
Arundel, where the family can be traced to John de Goring, living in
the reign of Edward II. Burton, in this county, was the seat of the
principal and elder line of the family, created Baronets in 1662,
extinct in 1723. Of a younger branch was the celebrated George Lord
Goring 1628, Earl of Norwich 1644, (which titles were extinct on the
death of his third son, but heir, the second Lord, in 1670,) sprung
from the second son of Sir William Gorynge, of Burton, who died in
1553.</p>

<p>The present family is descended from the second son of Sir Henry

<p>The name is local, from Pelham, in Hertfordshire, the
seat of the ancestors of this family in the time of Edward I., and
probably even before the Conquest. In the 28th of Edward I., Walter
de Pelham had a confirmation grant of lands in Heilsham, Horsey, &amp;c.
in this county. From the reign of Edward III. the Pelhams have been
a most important Sussex family; it was in that reign that Sir John
Pelham assumed the Buckle as his badge, in token of his claim to the
honour of taking John King of France prisoner at the battle of
Poictiers. Laughton belonged to the Pelhams before 1403, but has
been long deserted as the residence of the family.</p>

<p>Although there is no doubt of the antiquity of the
house of Shelley, the accounts of the earlier descents of the family
are very scanty. Originally of the county of Huntingdon, the
Shelleys are said to have removed into this county at a very early
period. But the earliest mention we have in history of any of this
family is of John and Thomas Shelley, who, following the fortunes of
Richard II., were attainted and beheaded in the first year of Henry
IV. The remaining brother, Sir William Shelley, not being connected
with the followers of Richard II., retained his possessions, and was
the ancestor of this family, who in the reign of Henry VI., by a
match with the heiress of Michelgrove, of Michelgrove, in Clapham,
was seated at that place, which continued the residence of the
Shelleys until the year 1800, when it was sold, and Maresfield
became the family seat.</p>

<p>The Wests are remarkable, not so much for the
antiquity of the family as for the early period at which they
attained the honour of the peerage. Sir Thomas West is the first
recorded ancestor; he died in the seventeenth of Edward II., having
married the heiress of Cantilupe, and thus became possessed of lands
in Devonshire, and at Snitterfield in Warwickshire. His grandson,
Thomas, married the heiress of De la Warr, and thus became connected
with Sussex. But the principal property of the Wests in this county
was granted to Thomas West, afterwards Lord la Warr, in the first
year of Henry VII. Few families indeed had broader lands; among
which may be mentioned, Offing<span class="hyphen"></span><span id="page257" class="pagenum"></span>ton, in the parish of
Broadwater, derived from the heiress of Peverel at the end of the
fourteenth century; and Halnaker, in the parish of Boxgrove, both in
Sussex; and Wherwell, in Hampshire; all now alienated. Buckhurst
came to the present Lord by his marriage with the coheiress of
Sackville.</p>

<p>Younger Branch. West of Ruthyn Castle, Denbighshire, descended from
the younger son of John, second Earl De la Warr.</p>

<p>The Wests of Alscot, in the county of Gloucester, claim to be
descended from Leonard, the younger son of Sir Thomas West, Lord De
la Warr, K.G., who died in the year 1525, although there is nothing
but "family tradition," as is evident by the memorial to the Earl
Marshal of Mr. James West, of Alscot, dated December 12, 1768, to
justify this assumption; a distinct coat, viz. <i>Argent, a fess
dancette pean</i>, was granted to Mr. West on this occasion.</p>

<p>Sasuualo, or Sewallis, whose name, says Dugdale,

of Warwick. Until the reign of Edward III., Eatington appears to

assumed in the twelfth century from the manor of Shirley, in
Derbyshire, and which, with Ratcliffe-on-Sore, in the county of
Nottingham, and Rakedale and Staunton-Harold, in Leicestershire,
derived from the heiresses of Basset and Staunton, succeeded, during
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as the usual residence of
the chiefs of the house. In the sixteenth century, Astwell, in
Northamptonshire, was brought into the family by the heiress of
Lovett; and in 1615, by the marriage of Sir Henry Shirley with the
coheiress of Devereux, a moiety of the possessions of the Earls of
Essex, after the extinction of that title in 1646, centred in Sir
Robert Shirley, father of the first Earl Ferrers; on whose death, in
1717, the family estates were divided, the Derbyshire,
Leicestershire, and Staffordshire estates descending with the
earldom to the issue of his first marriage, and<span id="page262" class="pagenum"></span> the

<p>Although the early part of the pedigree of the

the Conquest. Arnulphus de Compton and Osbertus de Compton were
living in the 16th of Henry II., but Philip de Compton is the first
of the name who certainly held the manor of Compton, in the fifth of
John. Here the family continued resident for many ages; but its

the year 1845; and the same arms are still to be traced on an
ancient mutilated monument of a knight with collar of S.S., supposed
to represent Sir Thomas de Compton, in the church of Compton
Wyniate. The three helmets were afterwards adopted, and appear to
have been the arms of a distinct family, the Comptons of Fenny
Compton in this county; to which Henry VIII. gave the lion as an
augmentation; at the same time, according to the custom of the
period, was added a quartering to the family arms, viz.: <i>Argent, a

<p>This family is stated by Thomas, in his additions to
Dugdale's Warwickshire, to be a branch of the Stauntons of Staunton,
in the county of Nottingham, an ancient house which is traced to the
Conquest, and was lately represented by Sir George Staunton, Baronet
of Ireland 1785, extinct 1859. The first of the line seated in
Warwickshire was Thomas Staunton, in the 39th of Henry VI., 1461.
The parent house, existing in the male line, until the year 1688, at
Staunton, in Nottinghamshire, held their lands by tenure of
<i>Castle-Guard</i>, by keeping and defending a tower in the Castle of
Belvoir, to this day called Staunton Tower. There is an ancient
custom also that the chief of the house of Staunton should present
the key of this tower to any of the Royal Family who may honour
Belvoir with their presence.</p>

<p>The sole remains of what was perhaps during the
middle ages the most powerful Norman family in England. Illustrious
both for the antiquity of race, the former political consequence,
and the splendour of connection of the various branches, of which
the forfeited Earls of Derby, and De Ferrariis, or Ferrers, were the
chiefs. Descended from Henry de Feriers at the time of the Conquest,
who held in chief 210 lordships in fourteen counties of England,
besides the castle and borough of Tutbury, in Staffordshire, the
principal seat of the earldom.</p>

<p>The Baddesley-Clinton line was founded by Sir Edward Ferrers, (son
of Sir Henry, who was second son of Thomas Ferrers, of Tamworth
Castle, in this county,) by his marriage with Constantia, daughter
and heiress of Nicholas Brome, of Baddesley. He died in 1535.</p>

<p>After the forfeiture of the Earldom of Derby, in the reign of Henry
III., and the vast possessions attached to it, the Castle of
Chartley, in Staffordshire, inherited from Agnes, daughter and
coheir of Ranulph, Earl of Chester, became the seat of the principal
male line, extinct on the death of William Lord Ferrers of Chartley
in the 28th of Henry VI. The representation of the family thereupon
devolved on the Ferrers's of Tamworth, sprung from the house of
Groby, who were founded by William, younger brother of the last Earl
of Derby: and on the decease of John Ferrers, of Tamworth, Esq. in
1680, the present family of Baddesley-Clinton succeeded as chief of
this illustrious house.</p>

<p>The antiquity of this family need not be doubted,
although the lineal descent, as Dugdale avouches, is not very plain.
William de Suckeberge is presumed to be the first who assumed the
name, from Shuckborough Superior, in this county; he was living in
the third of John. The pedigree is deduced by Baker, in his History
of Northamptonshire, from John de Shuckburgh, living in the first of
Edward III. In the seventh of Henry V. his great-grandson William is
ranked amongst those knights and esquires of this county who bore
ancient arms from their ancestors. It was to Richard Shuckburgh,
head of the family in 1642, that the remarkable incident happened
which is related by Dugdale. Charles I.<span id="page273" class="pagenum"></span> having met him hunting
with his hounds a day or two before the battle of Edgehill, "Who is
that," said the King, "hunting so merrily, while I am about to fight
for my crown and dignity?" He was knighted the next day, and proved
his loyalty at the battle of Edge-hill. He died in 1656, and his son
was rewarded with the Baronetcy on the Restoration.</p>

<p>The name is derived from Throcmorton, in the parish
of Fladbury, in the county of Worcester, where John de Trockemerton,
the supposed ancestor of this family, was living about the year
1200. From this John descended, after many generations, another
"John Throkmerton," who was, according the Leland, "the first setter
up of his name to any worship in Throkmerton village, the which was
at that tyme neither of his inheritance or purchase,<span id="page274" class="pagenum"></span> but as a
thing taken of the Sete of Wircester in farme, bycause he bore the
name of the lordeship and village. This John was Under-Treasurer of
England about the tyme of Henry V.;" and married Elianor, daughter
and coheir of Guido de la Spine, and thus became possessed of
Coughton, in the parish of Hadley, in this county, which has
continued the principal seat of the family, of whom the most
remarkable was Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, ambassador in France, in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who died in 1570.</p>

<p>Younger Branches (now extinct), were the Throckmortons of Stoughton
and Ellington, in Huntingdonshire, [for the latter see Camden's
Visitation of that county in 1613, printed by the Camden Society in
1849, p. 123;] and the Carews of Bedington, in Surrey, Baronet 1714,

<p>The descent of this family from the ancient house of
Sheldon, of Sheldon, in this county, is a matter of doubt, but
admitted by Dugdale to be not improbable. It appears to be proved
that the Sheldons are descended from John Sheldon, of Abberton, in
Worcestershire, in the reign of Henry IV. Nash, in his History of
that county, carries the pedigree two descents higher, viz., to
Richard Sheldon of Rowley, in the county of Stafford, whose grandson
John was of the same place in the fourth of Edward IV. The manor of
Beoly, in Worcestershire, was purchased of Richard Neville Lord
Latimer by William Sheldon in the same reign, and continued till the
destruction of the mansion-house by fire in the Civil Wars of the
seventeenth century, the principal seat of the family, who were
connected with Warwickshire by the marriage of William Sheldon, Esq.
with Mary, daughter and coheir of William Willington, of Barcheston,
Esq., in the reign of Henry VIII. It was this William Sheldon who
purchased the manor of Weston, in the parish of Long-Compton, in
this county, and here his son Ralph built "<i>a very fair house</i>" in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth; but these estates have both, within
the memory of man, passed from this ancient family, who still
possess considerable properly at Brailes, purchased by William
Sheldon in the first of Edward VI.</p>

<p>Younger branches of the Sheldons were formerly of Abberton,
Childswicombe, Broadway, and Spechley, in Worcestershire. See

<p>This great historical family is of Norman origin,
descended from Roger de Seimor, or Seymour, who lived in the reign
of Henry I. Woundy, Penhow, and Seymour Castle, all in the county of
Monmouth, (the last sold in the reign of Henry VIII.,) were ancient
seats of the family, who we find in the fourteenth century resident
in Somersetshire, after the marriage of Sir Roger Seymour with the
coheiress of Beauchamp of Hache; his grandson married the heiress of
Esturmi or Sturmey of Chadham, in this county, and thus first became
connected with Wiltshire. Maiden-Bradley belonged to Sir Edward
Seymour, the elder, the eldest surviving son of the Protector
Somerset by his first wife, and the ancestor of the present family,
who in 1750, on the death of the seventh Duke of Somerset, succeeded
to the Dukedom, which by special entail went first to the
descendants of the Protector by his second wife, until the
extinction of her male line in that year.</p>

<br><img src="images/arms_page284.jpg" alt="arms_page284.jpg" class="img_left">
<p>A Norman family, which for centuries has flourished
in the West of England, traced by Dugdale to "Rogerius Arundel,"
mentioned in Domesday. "The most diligent inspection, however,"
writes Hoare in his Wiltshire, "of an immense collection of ancient
charters, deeds, and instruments of all kinds, and from the earliest
periods of documentary evidence, among the archives of Wardour
Castle, have not enabled us to trace the filiation of this House
from<span id="page284" class="pagenum"></span> the said Rogerius." Reinfred de Arundell, who lived at the
end of the reign of Henry III. stands therefore at the head of the
pedigree as given by Hoare. Gilbert in his "Survey of Cornwall," is
inclined to believe the name to be derived from Arundel in Sussex,
and refers to "Yorke's Union of Honour." He says the family came
into Cornwall by a match with the heiress of Trembleth about the
middle of the twelfth century. Lanherne, in that county, was in the
fourteenth century their principal seat. The Castle of Wardour was
purchased by Sir Thomas Arundell from Sir Fulke Greville in 1547.</p>

<p>Camden, Carew, and Leland unite in recording the hospitality and
honourable demeanour of this family, in all relations of social
life, and state that from the pre-eminence of their ample
possessions they were popularly designated "The Great Arundells."</p>

<p>The name is derived from a place in the Vale of

Elizabeth, heiress of Sir Thomas Lyttleton, of Frankley, married
Thomas Westcote of Westcote, in the county of Devon, Esquire, "but
the old knight, her father, desirous to perpetuate his name, (and
his purpose failed not,) would not yield consent to the marriage but

<p>This great historical family is traced to the
Conquest, Richard Talbot, living at that period, being the first
recorded ancestor. No family in England is more connected with the
history of our country than this noble race; few are more highly
allied. The Marches of Wales appear to be the original seat;
afterwards we find the Talbots in Shropshire, in Staffordshire,
(where their estates were inherited from the Verdons in the time of
the Edwards,) and lastly in Yorkshire, at Sheffield, derived from
the great heiress of Neville Lord Furnival. This was the seat of the
first seven Earls of Shrewsbury, of whom an excellent biographical
account will be found in Hunter's Hallamshire (p. 43). The manor of
Grafton, formerly the estate of the Staffords, was granted by Henry
VII. to Sir Gilbert Talbot in 1486; it afterwards became the seat of
a younger branch, who eventually, on the death of the eighth Earl,
became Earls of Shrewsbury, from whom all the succeeding Earls, to
the decease of Bertram Arthur, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury, in 1856,
were descended. The present and 18th Earl, who is also the 3rd Earl
Talbot, springs from the second marriage of Sir John Talbot of
Albrighton in Shropshire, and of Grafton, in this county, who died

<br><img src="images/arms_page298.jpg" alt="arms_page298.jpg" class="img_left">
<p>This is a Warwickshire family of good antiquity,
traced to Robert de Boreton, grandfather of William, who lived in
the reign of Edward III. In that of Henry VI. by the heiress of
Allesley, the family became possessed of the manor of Lawford, which
remained their residence till the murder of Sir Theodosius Boughton,
Baronet, by his brother-in-law Mr. Donnellan, in 1781. After that
event, a younger branch succeeding to the estate and title, Lawford
Hall was pulled down, and the ninth Baronet, on inheriting the
property of the Rouses of Rouse-Lench, in this county, assumed that
name, and made it his seat and residence.</p>

<p>William FitzGodric, who married Albreda de Lizours,
Lady of Sprotsborough, in this county, and who died before 1195, is
the remote ancestor of this ancient house. Their son, William
FitzWilliam, was seated at Sprotsborough in the reign of Henry II.,
and here the family continued till the extinction of the elder line,
which ended in coheiresses in the reign of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>The rise of this branch of the family must be ascribed to Sir
William Fitzwilliam, Lord Justice, and afterwards Lord Deputy of
Ireland, in the reign of Elizabeth, whose grandson was created Baron
Fitzwilliam in 1620. In the year 1565, Hugh Fitzwilliam collected
whatever evidences could be found touching the descent of the
family. This account, which is in the possession of Earl
Fitzwilliam, is the foundation of most of the histories of this
great family, whose present Yorkshire property came from the
Wentworths through the coheiress of the Marquis of Rockingham in
1744. From this match resulted the Earldom in 1746.</p>

<p>Few families were more important in the fourteenth

descent is unbroken from the Conquest. Few houses also have been
more distinguished by the number of great offices of honour held
both in Church and State. The Scropes were very early settled in
Yorkshire, Bolton being, from the period of the reign of Edward I.,
their principal seat and Barony. The present family is sprung from a
younger son of Henry, 6th Lord Scrope of Bolton; it was established
at Danby about the middle of the seventeenth century, by marriage
with the heiress of Conyers.</p>

<p>This ancient Norman family is said to be descended
from Sir Humphry de Wyvill, who lived at the time of the Conquest,
and whose descendants were seated at Slingsby in this county; the
more modern part of the pedigree begins with Robert Wyvill of Ripon,
whose son was of Little Burton, in the reign of Henry VIII.; from
thence the family migrated to Constable-Burton, about the end of the
reign of James I. During the Civil Wars of the seventeenth century,
the Wyvills were distinguished by their loyalty and consequent

<br><img src="images/arms_page303.jpg" alt="arms_page303.jpg" class="img_left">
<p>The pedigree of this ancient family is traced to
Roger, whom Dr. Whitaker calls "Progenitor of this the oldest and
most distinguished of the Craven families now surviving. That this
man was a Norman the name will not permit us to doubt; that he was a
dependant of Roger of Poitou is extremely probable; that he was at
all events possessed of Bracewell (in Craven) early in the reign of
Henry I., is absolutely certain." Dr. Whitaker proceeds to remark on
the name of Tempest, which he says, "whatever was its origin, seems
to have been venerated by the family, as in the two next centuries,
when local appellation became almost universal, they never chose to
part with it." The elder line of the Tempests continued at Bracewell
till the time of Charles I., when Richard Tempest, the last
representative, pulled down the family house, and devised the estate
to a distant relation. The house of Broughton descends directly from
Roger, second son of Sir Peirs Tempest, which Roger married in the
seventh of Henry IV. Katharine daughter and heir of Peter Gilliott
of Broughton, which has been ever since the seat of the Tempests&mdash;
"a name never stained with dishonour, but often illustrated with
deeds of arms."</p>

<p>A younger branch was of Tong in this county, descended from Henry,
youngest son of Sir Richard Tempest of Bracewell, Sheriff of
Yorkshire in the 8th of Henry VIII. created Baronet in 1664, extinct
1819.</p>

<p>One of the most ancient families in the North of
England, according to Dr. Whitaker, descended from Richard de
Hamerton, who lived in the twenty-sixth of Henry II., anno 1170.
From Hamerton, the original seat, the family removed to Hellifield,
acquired by marriage with the heiress of Knolle, in the reign of
Edward III. The Castle, or Peel, was built in the reign of Henry
VII. The Hamertons were engaged in the Northern Rebellion in 1537,
and thereby Sir Stephen Hamerton lost his head, and his family the
estate; which was restored to the male representative of the family,
in the third year of Elizabeth, by a munificent settlement made by
John Redman, who had become possessed of the property, and was
related by marriage to the Hamertons. A younger branch was of
Preston-Jacklyn in this county.</p>

<p>"The truly ancient family of Fairfax," as Camden

In 1205 (sixth of John,) Richard Fairfax, the first of the family
proved by evidence, was possessed of the lands of Ascham, not far
from the City of York. His grandson William purchased the Manor of
Walton in the West Riding, which continued for near six hundred
years, till the extinction of the elder male line of the family in

son of Richard Fairfax, of Walton, Chief Justice of England in the
reign of Henry VI. the present family is descended, as well as
Fairfax of Denton, Baron Fairfax of Cameron in Scotland (1627,) who
represents an elder line,* and who resides in the United States of

<p>A remote branch of an ancient Nottinghamshire family,
which can be traced to the time of Henry II. The name is derived
from Markham, near Tuxford, in that county, but Coatham was
afterwards the family seat, until it was sold by Markham, "a fatal
unthrift," who was the brother of the antiquary Francis Markham;
this was about the end of the reign of Elizabeth. William Markham,
Archbishop of York, who died in 1807, was the ancestor and restorer
of this worthy family; he was descended from Daniel, a younger son
of the House of Coatham. Becca-Hall has been in possession of the
Markhams since the end of the last century.</p>

Condover, in Shropshire, an estate which remained in the family
until the reign of James I., although the Burtons became resident at
Longner, in the same county, prior to the reign of Edward IV.
"Goiffrid de Bortona," (Burton,) one of the foresters of Shropshire,
in the reign of Henry I., is the first recorded ancestor. The senior
line of this house terminated with Thomas Burton, who died unmarried
in 1730, and whose sister carried the Longner estate to the Lingen
family, who have assumed the name of Burton (see p. 198.) Thomas,
fifth son of Thomas Burton, of Longner, is the ancestor of the
present family, and of the Marquess of Conyngham (elder brother of
the late Lord Londesborough). He went to Ireland in the reign of
James I., and died there in 1665. His great-grandson married the
heiress of Conyngham. The late Lord assumed the name of Denison on
succeeding to the estates of his uncle W. J. Denison, Esq.</p>

single instance of the male line being maintained in its ancient
port and rank out of all the gentry of the Deanery of Doncaster,
summoned to appear before the Heralds in 1584." The pedigree begins
with Sir William de Anne, Constable of the Castle of Tickhill in the
time of Edward II. He married the coheiress of Haringel, from whom
came the manor of Frickley, sold in the latter part of the
eighteenth century. Burgh-Wallis came from the heiress of Fenton in
the reign of Elizabeth. Mr. Hunter observes, "The Annes, like too
many other families, have not been careful of preserving their
ancient evidences, and theirs was not one of the muniment rooms to
which our diligent antiquary Dodsworth had access."</p>

<p>The pedigree is traced to the sixth of Edward II.,
when John de Lister was resident at Derby. He married the daughter
and heiress of John de Bolton, Bowbearer of Bollond, and thus became
connected with this county. The elder line was of Mydhope, or
Middop, and afterwards, in the reign of Philip and Mary, of Thornton
in Craven, and became extinct in 1667. The present family is sprung
from Thomas, second son of Christopher Lister, who lived in the time
of Edward IV. The Listers were of Gisburn early in the sixteenth
century, the ancient seat of Arnoldsbiggin in that manor being their
seat for many generations. Lyster, of Rowton, in Shropshire, is
supposed to be a branch of this family, though there is no evidence
of the fact; Rowton has been in possession of the Lysters since
1482.</p>

Wombwell, living in the reign of Edward III. The elder branch of
this family became extinct in the male line on the death of William
Wombwell of Wombwell, Esq. in 1733. Part of the estate from whence

<br>
<br>    As the text below "DIGBY OF MILTON" suggests, the placename
    [Milton] should be [Tilton]. Confirmation for this has been
    found in "the Leicestershire Historian", vol. 2, no. 8 (the
    article "The Tilton Family in America and its Link with Tilton
    on the Hill" written by Peter D. A. Blakesley), page 7:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
